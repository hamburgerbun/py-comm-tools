py-comm-tools
=============

an object-oriented communications toolbox for large-scale modeling of (wireless) communication systems. 

Introduction
============

My name is Joshua Yuan, and I want not to port any existing communications toolbox over from say, MATLAB or anything, but to write my own toolbox to support point-to-point communication as well as simulation of multiple access and interference channel models. My goals, aside from becoming well-acquainted with Python and Git, are
 - create a communications package anybody can use
 - allow to setting up of point-to-point, multiple access, or large-scale interference channel simulations
 - given some parameters, allow for quick setup of simulations above with pre-set objects
 - include as comprehensive of a list of relevant algorithms and methods as humanly possible for communication systems.
